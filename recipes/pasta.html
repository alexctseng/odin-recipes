    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
    Pesto penne pasta is a delicious and flavorful dish that combines the classic Italian pasta, 
    penne, with a rich and fragrant pesto sauce. Penne is a type of short, tube-shaped pasta that is 
    typically made from durum wheat flour and water. The pasta is cooked by boiling it in water 
    until it is al dente, or firm to the bite.

    <p>
    The pesto sauce is made from a blend of fresh basil leaves, garlic, pine nuts, Parmesan cheese,
    and olive oil. The ingredients are typically crushed or blended together in a food processor 
    to create a smooth and creamy sauce. The sauce is then tossed with the cooked penne pasta, 
    creating a dish that is both hearty and flavorful. Pesto Penne pasta is a perfect dish for 
    vegetarians, and it can be served as a main course or side dish.
