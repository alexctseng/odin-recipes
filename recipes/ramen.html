    <h1>Tonkotsu Ramen</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Tonkotsu ramen is a popular Japanese dish that is made with a rich and creamy pork bone broth. The broth is 
    traditionally made by simmering pork bones for hours, sometimes even up to a full day, to extract all of the 
    flavor and collagen from the bones. This results in a broth that is thick, milky, and has a rich pork flavor. 
    The broth is then paired with thin, chewy noodles and topped with a variety of ingredients such as sliced pork,
    green onions, and nori (dried seaweed). Some tonkotsu ramen also features a soft-boiled egg, which adds a creamy
     texture to the dish. The dish is often garnished with black garlic oil, sesame seeds and chili oil for added flavor.

    Tonkotsu ramen is a hearty and comforting dish that is perfect for cold weather or a satisfying meal. The broth 
    is rich and creamy, and the pork and egg add a nice richness and depth of flavor. The combination of the broth, 
    noodles, and toppings creates a satisfying and flavorful dish that is a staple in Japanese cuisine and it's now 
    popular around the world. Many ramen shops and restaurants offer variations of tonkotsu ramen, with different 
    toppings, broths, and seasoning to cater to different tastes. Tonkotsu ramen is a must-try for anyone who loves 
    Japanese cuisine or is looking for a satisfying and comforting meal.

    <h5>Chashu Pork Belly</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lb pork Belly</li>
        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sake</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>2-3 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>2 green onions</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Soy Bacon Tare</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices bacon</li>
        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp mirin</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp sake</li>
        <li>4 Tbsp shiro miso</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Miso Tare</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup </li>
        <li>1/4 cup sake</li>
        <li>1/4 cup mirin</li>
        <li>pinch shichimi togarashi</li>
        <li>1-2 tsp kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h5>Chashu Pork Belly</h5>
    <ol>
    <li>Combine the soy, sake, mirin, sugar, garlic and green onions in a ziploc bag large 
        enough to hold the pork belly. Stick a straw in the bag and seal the ziploc bag up 
        against it (so the straw is the only opening). Suck as much of the air out as you 
        can and seal.</li>
    <li>Sous vide the pork for 10-11 hours at 170F.</li>
        <li>Remove pork from the ziploc bag. Discard the bag and marinade.</li>
        <li>Let the chashu pork belly cool completely.</li>
        <li>Slice across the chashu pork (so you get bacon like slices) - into 8-12 slices 
            about 1/8 to 3/16 inches thick. Reserve. You won't need all the pork for 4 
            servings.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h5>Soy Bacon Tare</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine all the ingredients in a small sauce pan. Simmer at the lowest 
            setting for about an hour. Top up with a bit of chicken stock if needed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the bacon.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h5>Miso Tare</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine all ingredients in a small sauce pan and simmer at the 
            lowest setting for about 5 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h5>Medium Boiled Egg</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring enough water to cover the eggs to a boil. If you have a way to prick the 
            eggshell do it. Boil large eggs for 6 minutes 30 seconds. If using extra large
             eggs boil them for 7 minutes 30 seconds. You may have to adjust your times 
             slightly depending on the exact size of your eggs but this should get you 
             pretty close.
        </li>
        <li>
            Submerge the eggs in cold or ice water to chill. This stops the egg yolks from 
            continuing to set up. Peel. Cut in half right before you serve your tonkotsu ramen.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h5>Assemble the Tonkotsu Ramen</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Boil the ramen noodles in plenty of water as directed by the packaging.
             If there's no translation on the packaging usually its 4 minutes. You don't 
             need to salt the water.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook the mushrooms along side the noodles - you just want them softened.   
        </li>
        <li>
            Gently fry the chashu pork in a non-stick skillet until lightly browned.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place 1/4 of whichever tare you are using in the bottom of four bowls.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ladle in about 1/2 cup of the tonkotsu broth into each of the bowls and stir to mix.
        </li>
    <li>
        Add the noodles. Pour in another 1 1/2 cups of the tonkotsu broth per bowl.
    </li>
    <li>
        Top with the egg, mushrooms, pork and green onions.
    </li>
    </ol>
