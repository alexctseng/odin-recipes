    <h3>Descriptions</h3>
    <p>
        Carne asada tacos are a traditional Mexican dish that consists of grilled beef, 
        typically skirt or flank steak, that is marinated in a flavorful blend of spices and 
        lime juice. The meat is then sliced thin and served on small corn tortillas. The tacos 
        are typically garnished with diced onions, cilantro, and a squeeze of lime juice. They 
        can also be served with a variety of toppings such as salsa, guacamole, or cheese.</p>
    <p>
        Carne asada tacos are often considered one of the most popular street foods in Mexico and 
        are a staple at taquerias and food trucks. They are also a common dish at Mexican-style 
        barbecue gatherings and are served as a main course at many family gatherings and parties. 
        The rich, bold flavors and tender texture of the meat make carne asada tacos a favorite among 
        taco lovers

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Carne Asada: I typically use flank steak when making carne asada, but skirt steak works as
            well. Make sure to read my carne asada recipe for tips and specifics on grilling the 
            perfect steak! 
        </li>
        <li>
            Avocado: I smashed plain avocado into the tortilla, but you could use guacamole as well.
        </li>
        <li>
            Onion: Diced yellow, white, or red onions will work.
        </li>
        <li>
            Lime: A squeeze of fresh lime juice is a must.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cilantro: You can never go wrong with a sprinkle of fresh cilantro.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cheese: Cotija cheese is always my go-to for Mexican tacos.
        </li>
        <li>
            Tortillas: I love to make my cassava flour tortillas, but any will do!
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>

        <li>
            Once you've grilled your steak, let the fun begin! Just grab a tortilla and slather it with
             some avocado. No need for perfect avocado slices (carne asada tacos are not trying to be
              fancy). Just use a spoon to mash up the avocado and slather it on
        </li>
        <li>
            Then, add a good helping of chopped carne asada, a sprinkle of cotija or queso fresco 
            cheese, chopped onion and fresh cilantro. Squeeze some fresh lime on top and there you
             have it - perfect carne asada tacos!
