        Carne asada tacos are a traditional Mexican dish that consists of grilled beef, 
        typically skirt or flank steak, that is marinated in a flavorful blend of spices and 
        lime juice. The meat is then sliced thin and served on small corn tortillas. The tacos 
        are typically garnished with diced onions, cilantro, and a squeeze of lime juice. They 
        can also be served with a variety of toppings such as salsa, guacamole, or cheese.</p>
